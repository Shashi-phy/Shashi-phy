- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shashi
- 👀 I’m interested in developing new ways to solve the Hamiltonian of the real materials using frist prinicple calculations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning wannier interpolation of linear and non-linear optical responses of crystals.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on wannier90 and wannierberri formalism for optical responses.
